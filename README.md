# Parking-Validation

#This is a project I came up with based on a task I was given at work.

#Every month an excel document is released regarding dialysis administration parking at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics

#Dialysis administration are only allowed to park in a certain parking space on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday

#(See example excel sheet)

#What this script does:

        1. Loops through staff ID numbers.
        
        2. Fills in name of staff member name using a dictionary.
        
        3. Loops through the times that each vehicle parked.
        
        4. Determine if it was a Mon, Wed, or Fri.
        
        5. Fill in which day of the week they parked.
